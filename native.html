            <p style="align-self:right;">React Native is an open-source framework created by Facebook with a declarative programming paradigm for building native mobile apps using JavaScript. React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Using React Native, developers do not need to create separate codes for different platforms (iOS or Android), as Javascript could be used for both. Specifically, the ability to reuse code increases efficiency brings super-quick development results and reduces cost. Also, the mobile app development process considerably speeds up due to the existing open-source libraries, including UI ones.</p>
            <p>React Native was first released by Facebook as an open-source project in 2015. In just a couple of years, it became one of the top solutions used for mobile development. React Native development is used to power some of the world’s leading mobile apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and Skype. Building cross-platform applications can be 30% cheaper than building native apps, all thanks to the ability to reuse code and faster development, which directly impacts the cost.
